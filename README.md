# Tableau-Homework---Citi-Bike-Analytics

I created visualizations based on starting locations, gender, subscribers vs customers, and age statistics within the period of 2019 to April 2020 Summary of key findings can be found below:
70% of riders are men and 26% are female and 5% are unknown.
The Total Number of Bike Trip is 4809156 which is 361921 has  annual pass and 43026 are customer in 2019 
1st and 2nd peak hours during a day would usually be 7-8 AM and 5-6 PM season-regardless since rides going to work at 7-8 AM and finish work at 5-6 PM. But in summer time the number of rides is more than winter time. 
base on the data I hypothesize there are the 10 top Citi bike locations to start and End  journey because they are in highly populated areas, near schools or public transportation hub. Also base on the data there are the least popular Citi bike location to start and  end a journey because they are in more remote and less populated areas that require further travel to access public transportation. 
The bike Id with the highest Milages are most likely due for repair or inspection.
